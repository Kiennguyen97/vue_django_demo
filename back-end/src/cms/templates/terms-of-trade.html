                <p>1.2 Interpretation</p>
                <p>In this Agreement unless a contrary intention appears: A reference to a person includes any
                    other entity or association recognised by law and the reverse. Any reference to any of the

                    binds and benefits those persons jointly and severally.</p>
                <p>2.0 Acceptance</p>
                <p>2.1 Any instructions received by the Seller from the Customer for the supply of Goods and/or
                    the Customer’s acceptance of Goods supplied by the Seller shall constitute acceptance of the

                <p>2.2 Upon acceptance of these terms and conditions by the Customer the terms and conditions
                    are binding and can only be amended with the written consent of the Seller.</p>
                <p>3.0 Price and Payment</p>
                <p>3.1 At the Seller’s sole discretion the Price shall be either: (a) as indicated on invoices

                <p>4.2 If the Seller agrees to deliver Goods the costs of delivery shall be in addition to the

                    Seller delivers Goods and if the Customer is unable to take delivery, the Seller shall be

                <p>The production of these terms and conditions by the Seller is sufficient evidence of the
                    Seller’s rights to receive the insurance proceeds without the need for any person dealing
                    with the Seller to make further enquiries.</p>

                    sold) and sale proceeds paid to clear monies owing by the Customer to the Seller. Upon such
                    notice being given the rights of the Customer to obtain ownership or any other interest in
                    the Goods shall cease; and</p>

                    Agreement by the Customer in respect of any monies owed to the Customer by the Seller. The
                    Customer shall not be entitled to set off against or deduct from the Price any sums owed or
                    claimed to be owed to the Customer by the Seller.</p>

                    strike, lock-out, industrial action, fire, flood, drought, storm or other event beyond the
                    reasonable control of either party.</p>

                    to, changes in the Customer’s address, facsimile number, or business practice).</p>
                <p>15.7 The failure by the Seller to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions shall
                    not be treated as a waiver of that provision, nor shall it affect the Seller’s right to
                    subsequently enforce that provision.</p>
